CAPSTONE

PROJECT

TEAM
Working with randomly assignmed groups can be tricky, but I think I got a pretty rad bunch of folks to work with.

#### \#TeamSelfie
One of the first things we did as a team.

RESOURCES
As with any study space in any university, it is pretty much impossible to find a space that satisfies these basic requirements:

* Reasonably quiet
* Power outlet within cord distance
* Table and chairs for around 4 people

Luckily Dr. Pritchard was able to hook us up with a sweet space at the [MAGIC](http://www.magic.ubc.ca/) lab at UBC. Now in addition to all of those points mentioned above, we have Tim Hortons nearby!


**41 days to go.**
