Recently the Viper team gave our very first presentation as a group. We presented our project proposal to Dr. Fels and our TA, Pooneh. I have a strong distaste for boring slides and unusual liking towards doodling. So I experimented with using the [Paper](https://www.fiftythree.com/paper) app to draw out my slides. Here are some of the slides we used:

The app is nifty and really fun to play around with. I have used it in the past to sketchnote recipes, but drawing out presentation slides worked out well. Especially when used in combination with a presentation software, to move around the images drawn on Paper and add other photos or videos. I have the [Pencil](http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil) stylus for it, so I was able to use all the tools that it offers - fountain pen, pencil, pen, marker, water colour for free!

I also tried out [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) for the first time! [rapper_man](https://www.fiverr.com/rapper_man) did this sweet 30 second rap for the project:
